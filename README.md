 ## 2019 Glasstire DataHack

The Glasstire Datahack is a two-day event where artists and data scientists unite to analyze and draw findings from a data set of art venues throughout the Greater Houston Area.

Looking through the data set provided by Glasstire, our team noticed a significant increase in the number of small, independent art venues in the Greater Houston Area.

In order to better visualize this trend, I individually contributed an interactive 3D volumetric plot of the entire data set. Venues are sorted by color, the ones with the fewest total events are blue and gradually turn purple as they increase in total events hosted. It was built using both D3.js and three.js libraries.
